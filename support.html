                    <h3>Response Times (Post-Launch Expectation)</h3>

                    <h3>Shipping and Delivery Policy (for Digital Services)</h3>
                    <p>As Freelogic.in is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, "Shipping and Delivery" refers to the provisioning and access to our digital services.</p>

                        <li><strong>Service Access:</strong> Upon successful subscription and payment confirmation (post-launch), your Freelogic.in account will be activated, and you will gain access to the features corresponding to your chosen plan.

                        <li><strong>Account Credentials:</strong> You will receive your login credentials (or instructions to set them up) via the email address provided during signup. It is your responsibility to keep these credentials secure.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Physical Shipping:</strong> There are no physical goods to be shipped. All services are delivered digitally through our web platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> We strive to ensure high availability of our services, subject to planned maintenance and unforeseen technical issues, as outlined in our <a href="terms-conditions.html">Terms & Conditions</a>.</li>

                        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Approved refunds will be processed back to the original method of payment within a certain number of business days (e.g., 5-10 business days), subject to payment processor timelines.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Cancellation and Refund Policy. Any changes will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email. Continued use of the service after such changes will constitute your consent to the revised policy.</p>
